# Zheremino

## WTF is Zheremino?
The intention is provide a good and new electronic musical instrument, inspired by theremin and build around and arduino. Zheremino, as theremin does, plays notes without touching the instrument, but with different phisical and artistic concept under the shell.

##How it works?
Zheremino actually provides IR pitch control, switching between diferent scales, and also provides manual velocity control.

##How it sounds?
I forget to tell you. Zheremino is a MIDI controller. So, don't provide any sound, but the one you want to plug through the MIDI/USB connection. That's great because you can use any sound module or synthesizer or musical software you prefer.
